/*While this is a simple example, it demonstrates how the call stack steps through your code and calls multiple functions.Remove your callStack array, the a(), b(), and c() functions, and the console.log() statement.
//In computer science, a stack is a data structure where items are stored in a LIFO (last-in-first-out) manner. If you imagine a stack of books, the last book you add to the stack is the first book you can take off the stack. Or an array where you can only .push() and .pop() elements.The call stack is a collection of function calls stored in a stack structure. When you call a function, it is added to the top or of the stack, and when it returns, it is removed from the top / end of the stack.Initialize a variable named callStack and assign it an empty array.
const callStack = [
    //In your callStack array, add the following string: a(): returns "freeCodeCamp " + b(). This represents the function call and the code that will be executed.
    //'a(): returns "freeCodeCamp " + b()',
    //Next, add the following string to your callStack array: b(): returns "is " + c().
    //'b(): returns "is " + c()', 
    //And since b() calls c(), the function c() is added to the call stack.Add the following string to your callStack array: c(): returns "awesome!".
    //'c(): returns "awesome!"' //remove c() and //update b().
    //'b(): returns "is " + "awesome!"' //remove b() and update a() to the following: a(): returns "freeCodeCamp " + "is awesome!".
    //'a(): returns "freeCodeCamp " + "is awesome!"' //remove updated a().

These will make it easier to see how the decimal to binary conversion works.Remove the return statement from your decimalToBinary function. Then, declare variables named inputs, quotients, and remainders, and assign an empty array to each of them.

//const remainders = [];

//Your decimalToBinary function works well, but there is an issue â€“ because of the condition in your while loop, it only works for numbers greater than 0. If you try to convert 0 to binary, nothing will get added to the page.To fix this, add an if statement to check if input is equal to 0. Leave the body of the if statement empty for now.
//if (input === 0) {
//Within the body of the if statement, set the innerText property of result equal to the string 0. Then, use an early return statement to break out of the function early.
//  result.innerText = "0";
//  return;
//}

//For the decimal to binary conversion, you need to divide input by 2 until the quotient, or the result of dividing two numbers, is 0. But since you don't know how many times you need to divide input by 2, you can use a while loop to run a block of code as long as input is greater than 0 and can be divided.As a reminder, a while loop is used to run a block of code as long as the condition evaluates to true, and the condition is checked before the code block is executed.Create a while loop that runs as long as input is greater than 0. Leave the body of the loop empty for now.
//while (input > 0) {
/*//Inside your while loop, create a variable named quotient and assign it the value of input divided by 2.
const quotient = input/2;*/

//Like you saw in the last step, division can lead to a floating point number, or a number with a decimal point. The best way to handle this is to round down to the nearest whole number.Use the Math.floor() function to round down the quotient of input divided by 2 before it's assigned to quotient.
//  const quotient = Math.floor(input / 2);
//Inside your while loop, create a variable named remainder and use the remainder operator to assign it the remainder of input divided by 2.

/*//The tricky part about while loops is that, if you're not careful, they can run forever. This is called an infinite loop, and can cause your browser to crash.To avoid infinite loops, you need to make sure that the condition for the while loop eventually becomes false. In this case, you want to make sure that the input variable eventually becomes 0.Move the input = 0 statement into the body of the while loop. This will make it so that the loop will only run up to one time.

Then, set result.innerText equal to the binary number string.
//result.innerText = remainders.reverse().join("");

//There are some ways to improve it. For example, it's not necessary to keep track of the inputs and quotients. We can clean things up so the function is more efficient.First, remove everything in the body of the decimalToBinary function. Then, use let to create a variable named binary and assign it an empty string.

Instead of logging free, pausing for a second before logging Code, and finally logging Camp, you'll see this: free, Camp, Code.This is because the setTimeout() function is asynchronous, meaning that it doesn't stop the execution of the rest of your code. All the code in the showAnimation() function runs line by line, but because setTimeout() is asynchronous, free and Camp are logged to the console immediately, and then Code is logged to the console after a one second delay.One way to fix this is to use multiple setTimeout() functions. Use setTimeout() to log free to the console after half a second, or 500 milliseconds.
    //setTimeout(()=>{console.log("free")}, 500);

You don't have to sit in front of the oven waiting the entire time â€“ you can wash dishes, read a book, or do anything else while you wait for the timer to go off.Add a 1500 millisecond delay before the text Camp is logged to the console.
